title: Choose good names for things
description: "Data organization: naming things"
---


It's important to pick good names for things. This can be
hard, and so it's worth putting some time and thought into it.

As a general rule, don't use spaces, either in variable names (that
is, the names of the columns in your data) or in
file names. They make programming harder: the analyst will need to
surround everything in double quotes, like `"glucose 6 weeks"` rather
than just writing `glucose_6_weeks`. Where you might use spaces, use
underscores or perhaps hyphens. But don't use a mixture of underscores
and hyphens; pick one and [be consistent](consistency.html).

Be careful about extraneous spaces (say, at the beginning or end of a
variable name). "`glucose`" is different from "`glucose `" (with an
extra space at the end). Extraneous spaces can cause headaches later.

Avoid special characters, too. (Except for underscores and hyphens;
they're okay.) Other symbols (`$`, `@`, `%`, `#`, `&`, `*`, `(`, `)`,
`!`, etc.) often have special meaning in programming languages, and so
they can be harder to handle.  They're also a bit harder to type.

The main principle in choosing names, whether for variables or for
file names, is *short, but meaningful*. So not *too* short.

The [Data Carpentry](http://datacarpentry.org/)
[lesson on using spreadsheets](https://github.com/datacarpentry/excel-ecology/blob/gh-pages/02-common-mistakes.md)
has a nice table with good and bad example variable names:

**good name**       | **good alternative** | **avoid**
------------------- | -------------------- | ---------
`Max_temp`          | `MaxTemp1`           | `Maximum Temp (Â°C)`
`Precipitation`     | `Precipitation_mm`   | `precmm`
`Mean_year_growth`  | `MeanYearGrowth`     | `Mean growth/year`
`sex`               | `sex`                | `M/F`
`weight`            | `weight`             | `w.`
`cell_type`         | `CellType`           | `Cell type`
`first_observation` | `Observation_01`     | `1st Obs.`

I agree with all of this. I'd maybe cut down on some of the
capitalization. So maybe `max_temp`, `precipitation`, and `mean_year_growth`.

Finally, never include "`final`" in a file name. You'll invariably end up
with "`final_ver2`". I can't say that without referring to this
